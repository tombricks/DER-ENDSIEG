 GER_RK_party: "RMfdwG"
 GER_RK_party_long: "Reich Ministry for the Wider Territories"
 GER_RK_party_desc: "The RMfdwG was established from Rosenberg's former Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories, with Hitler seeing it fit that the territories gained after the war be not seen as occupied but as part of a \"wider Reich.\" Calling it a political party would not be an adapt description, rather a gang of German officials drunk with power who's primary goal with their annexed lands is to exploit them for the Fatherland."

 GER_DEN_party: "DNSAP"
 GER_DEN_party_long: "Danish National Socialist Workers' Party"
 GER_DEN_party_desc: "The DNSAP is the leading party in the Danish parliament, only gaining that position through Germany playing the hand they hold over the Danish protectorate they have occupied since 1940. The German occupational forces care not much about the civil administration, leaving it mostly to the DNSAP with the exception of the SS. Werner Best remains as a fearful watch over the nominally independent Kingdom as Reichsbevollmächtigter (Reich Plenipotentiary) and as one of the more powerful figures in the SS, his influence is not challenged by many."
 
 GER_NOR_party: "NS"
 GER_NOR_party_long: "National Gathering"
 GER_NOR_party_desc: "The Nasjonal Samling party, led by Quisling, rules in tandem over Norway with the occupying forces and the Reichskommissar. Quisling clearly takes a Deputy position in the leadership but clearly hopes to take more power. It is not daring to say that Quisling could take power in the next few years seeing as the Germans themselves in the mainland are becoming more and more unstable and that a bit of turbulence could knock the Reichskommissar out of power."
