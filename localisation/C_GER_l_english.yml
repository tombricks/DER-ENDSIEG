### National Spirits
 GER_Master_of_Europe: "The Masters of Europe"
 GER_Master_of_Europe_desc: "Germany is, without a doubt, the Master of Europe. With half the continent Reichskommissariats under direct control of the German government and much of the rest controlled through soft power and satellite states, there is no denying it. The Latin Bloc under influence of the Italian Empire may have substantial control over the Mediterranean but it is still clear that they are at the whims of the Reich Government in Berlin."
 GER_Broken_Economy: "Broken Economy"
 GER_Broken_Economy_desc: "For some unknown reason, not even the top government-backed economists can figure out what is wrong with our economy. We fellow a policy of Autarky and Self-Reliance built upon the looting and exploitation of the occupied Eastern Territories, not to mention a large slave base. Of course, we did experience a short-lived economic boom following our victory in the Second Great War but that has clearly not lasted. The Eastern Reichskommissariate which serve the purpose of being exploited for metropolitan Germany have clearly not been as... efficient as we hoped."
 GER_Party_in_Flames: "A Party in Flames"
 GER_Party_in_Flames_desc: "The NSDAP is, simply put, a party in flames which runs a state that is decaying. The Führer is a drug-hooked maniac who clearly has begun to lose his sense of direction in running the Empire, while his current second in command, Bormann, is a bueracrat unliked by practically everyone else. Two of the most powerful men in the Reich, Göring and Himmler, have essentially left life in Germany to play in their own nations. The only seemingly stable official is Herr Goebbels, who is the heir apparent, but his likely succession isn't 100% secure giving the whole situation. Without a doubt, these next years will be vital in deciding the future of the party, the Reich, and the world itself."
 GER_Der_Widerstand: "Der Widerstand"
 GER_Der_Widerstand_desc: "The NSDAP cannot expect to rule unopposed. Sure, there are the threats of not-so-foreign intervention from Himmler and Göring in the succession crisis following the soon death of Hitler, but is the true threat from within Germany itself? Not much is known about the specifics of the resistance, but it is feared that they may not be as seperate as we thought. The Reichsbanner is a years old organisation from the times of the Republic, established by the liberal parties such as the SPD, yet we have begun to gather intel on a so-called \"§ORepublikbanner§!\" made up of socialists, democrats and communists alike. Is this just a minor rumour spread by fearmongerers who once saw what they vaguely thought as a red sheet in their neighbour's window, or is it truly a resistance movement growing right under our nose?"
