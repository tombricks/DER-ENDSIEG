### National Spirits
 OST_germanization: "Germanization"
 OST_germanization_desc: "One of the core tenants of nazi ideology is the drive for 'Lebensraum', living space for the Germanic people created trough the extermination of the 'inferior' slav and other people of eastern europe. The German Reich will stop at nothing when making sure new territory is properly turned into 'Lebensraum' ready for annexation into the Greater German Reich. The effect on this policy in colonial holdings has been disasterious as native disobedience and economic downturn keep increasing and increasing while the number of 'aryan' citizens is hardly improving"
 OST_revolting_natives: "Revolting Natives"
 OST_revolting_natives_desc: "An important part of running a Reichkommisariat is keeping native resistance under wraps. Here the colonial administration has failed, as more and more natives are joining underground revolutionary groups or engaging in anti-fascist activities. SS has had their influence greatly increased, with Jeckeln becoming the second-in command after Lohse. Still even with this increase in measures native resistance remains at an all-time high and doesn't look like its stopping"
 OST_Latvian_legionary_influence: "Latvian Legionary Influence"
 OST_Latvian_legionary_influence_desc: "As pacification efforts became more and more important to the Reichkommisariat native colaborators began rapidly rising trough the ranks of the government and military. Lohse took a particular liking towards the Latvian legionaries due to their fascist ideology and extreme anti-communism. Their biggest 'stars' are Viktors Arājs and Arvīds Blūmentāls, both being extreme Latvian nationalists and nazi sympathisers"
 OST_overbloated_wehrmacht: "Overbloated Wehrmacht"
 OST_overbloated_wehrmacht_desc: "As the war against Soviet Union was closing a lot of units no longer had a porpuse beyond anti-partisan activities, but due to high militarist influence these units were kept and even given bigger and bigger funding. The general state of the military is lackluster at best with most members being incompetent and stagnant in military practice, knowing far more about killing civilians than actually fighting. Matters are not made better by the fact that the military became an unemployment dump, so without a doubt reducing its scale would hurt the economy."
